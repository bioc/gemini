Title: GEMINI: Variational inference approach to infer genetic interactions from pairwise CRISPR screens
Version: 1.0.0

Description: GEMINI uses log-fold changes to model sample-dependent and independent effects,
	and uses a variational Bayes approach to infer these effects. The inferred effects
	are used to score and identify genetic interactions, such as lethality and recovery.
	More details can be found in Zamanighomi et al. 2019 (in press).
