Title: GEMINI: Variational inference approach to infer genetic interactions from pairwise CRISPR screens
Version: 0.99.0

Description: GEMINI uses log-fold changes to model sample-dependent and independent effects,
	and uses a variational Bayes approach to infer these effects. The inferred effects
	are used to score and identify genetic interactions, such as lethality and recovery.
